ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Aniruddha Maram!

With a strong foundation in Molecular Biology and a specialization in Genetics, I've embarked on an exciting journey to merge the realms of science and technology. My academic background has given me a unique perspective, and I'm now focused on infusing technological innovation into the world of genetics.

ðŸ”¬ Currently, I'm harnessing the power of Python, C, C++ , R and Prompt Engineering to explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of biology and coding. My journey in programming is just beginning, and I'm enthusiastic about learning the ropes of the tech world.

ðŸŒ± My GitHub journey is all about knowledge acquisition and unlocking new horizons. I believe in the collaborative spirit of the open-source community, and I'm here to contribute and connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you're an employer seeking a fresh perspective or an open-source enthusiast looking to collaborate, I'm excited to engage and share my evolving insights.

ðŸš€ As I continue to develop my programming skills, I'm open to exploring additional avenues that align with my interests and goals. If you have any suggestions or recommendations, I'm all ears! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, exchange ideas, or simply have a friendly chat.

Let's connect and shape the future together!
